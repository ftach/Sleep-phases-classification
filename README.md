# Sleep-phases-classification
Project aiming to classifiy de different sleep phases according signals like EEG ECG EMG ... 

This programme was originally conceived to add something extra to a project during my first year at La Pr√©pa des INP. 
The aim of this project was to teach us to conduct scientific research by answering the question 
"We have the technological means to show all the moments of our life on social 
our lives on social networks, except for our dreams. Can you imagine a device that allows 
to capture our dreams in order to share them. 
So we built a whole process in which determining the sleep phase of patients was one of the steps. 
of the steps. I thought that creating an AI to perform this task multiple times would save time.
Although the program can determine the sleep phase with a success percentage of only about 40-50% (hardly better than randomly), it is still a good idea to use the same method. 
(only slightly better than random), it also allows to recover the points of the curves of .edf 
files (the format in which most biological or medical records are stored) into matrices, determine 
other information about the recording such as duration, sampling frequency, unit of measurement, number of points forming the signal, etc. 
number of points forming the signal, etc. 

This project was carried out without any knowledge of machine learning or optimization but allowed me to understand the main technical aspects.
